## Modern Open-Source Big Data Solution for 4G, 5G Networks (3GPP XML) 
My role as the solution designer / associate technical lead was to analyze the existing system pain points and design a robust open source data solution, ensuring efficient parallel data ingestion and processing. Through close collaboration with client-side solution designers, I designed and implemented a tailored architecture with open-source big data tools that met their parallelization, multiprocessing requirements. My significant architecture designing & scala development contributions to data collection, preparation, storage, KPI calculation, analytics, visualization, and governance stages were integral to the project's success.
